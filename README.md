_Appium is a tool for automating native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS, Android, and Windows platforms. It supports iOS native apps written in Objective-C or Swift and Android native apps written in Java or Kotlin. It also supports mobile web apps accessed using a mobile browser (Appium supports Safari on iOS and Chrome or the built-in 'Browser' app on Android). Perform Appium automation tests on [TestMu AI's online cloud](https://www.testmuai.com/appium-mobile-testing)._

*Learn the basics of [Appium testing on the TestMu AI platform](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/getting-started-with-appium-testing/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-java).*

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing App automation testing with Appium, you would need to follow these steps:

- Ensure you have the [Java client library](https://github.com/appium/java-client) installed for Selenium and Appium.
- Download and install **Maven** following the steps from [the official website](https://maven.apache.org/). Maven can also be installed easily on **Linux/MacOS** using [**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/) package manager.
- Use JDK 8 or the higher version for better results.

### Clone The Sample Project

Clone the TestMu AI’s :link: [LT-appium-java-jbehave](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-java-jbehave) repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```js
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-java-jbehave
cd LT-appium-java-jbehave
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your TestMu AI credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-java) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-java).

Set TestMu AI `Username` and `AccessKey` in environment variables.

**For Linux/macOS:**

```js
export LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME \
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```

**For Windows:**

```js
set LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME `
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Upload Your Application

Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the TestMu AI servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File:**

**Linux/macOS:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"'
```

**Windows:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""
```

**Using App URL:**

**Linux/macOS:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"'
```

**Windows:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -d "{"url":"https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk","name":"sample.apk"}"
```

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on TestMu AI by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

## Run Your First Test

**Test Scenario:** Check out [TestMu AIJBehaveRunner.java](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-java-jbehave/blob/master/src/test/java/com/lambdatest/TestMu AIJBehaveRunner.java) file to view the sample test script.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as given below for single and parallel tests:

<Tabs className="docs__val">
<TabItem value="single-config" label="Single" default>

```java title="single.conf.json"

//Parallel Tests
{
    "server": "mobile-hub.lambdatest.com",
        "user": "user_name",
        "key": "access_key",
        
      "capabilities": {
        "build": "jbehave-LambdaTest-AppAutomate-Single",
        "name": "Single Test 1"
        },

        "environments": [
        {
        "platformName": "android",
        "deviceName": "Galaxy S21 5G",
        "platformVersion": "11"
        }
        ]
        }
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="parallel-config" label="Parallel" default>

```java title="parallel.conf.json"

// Parallel tests
{
  "server": "mobile-hub.lambdatest.com",
  "user": "user_name",
  "key": "access_key",

  "capabilities": {
    "build": "jbehave-LambdaTest-AppAutomate-Parallel",
    "name": "Parallel Test 1"
  },

  "environments": [
    {
      "platformName": "android",
      "deviceName": "Galaxy S21 5G",
      "platformVersion": "11"
    },
    {
      "platformName": "android",
      "deviceName": "OnePlus 10 Pro",
      "platformVersion": "12"
    },
    {
      "platformName": "android",
      "deviceName": "Pixel 3a",
      "platformVersion": "10"
    }
  ]
}

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Note:**

- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `"app"` capability in the config file.
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.testmuai.com/capabilities-generator/beta/index.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-java)**. A more Detailed Capability Guide is available [here](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-java).

## Executing The Test

- Update your app url, username and accesskey in the file `TestMu AIJBehaveRunner.java`.
- Execute the following commands to install the required dependencies:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
- Now run the given commands to test your application:
```bash
mvn test -P single  //to run a single test 
mvn test -P parallel  //to run parallel tests
```

**Info:** Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the :link: [TestMu AI App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-java).

## 🚀 LambdaTest is Now TestMu AI

👋 Welcome to TestMu AI, the next evolution of LambdaTest. As of January 2026, [LambdaTest is Now TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/lambdatest-is-now-testmuai/) - we have evolved from a cross-browser testing cloud into a unified, AI-native quality engineering platform designed for the modern DevOps era.

Whether you have been part of the LambdaTest community for years or are just discovering TestMu AI, our mission remains the same: to help you ship faster with high-scale test execution, autonomous testing, and deep quality analytics.

### 🔄 Our Rebrand Journey

In 2017, we introduced LambdaTest with a clear mission: to become the world's most trusted cloud testing platform. We built a scalable, high-performance test cloud that eliminated flakiness, improved developer feedback cycles, and accelerated release velocity for teams worldwide.

As LambdaTest grew, we expanded the platform into Test Intelligence, Visual Regression Testing, Accessibility Testing, API Testing, and Performance Testing, covering the entire testing lifecycle. These capabilities enabled teams to test any stack, on any technology, at enterprise scale.

Over time, we rebuilt the architecture to be AI-native from the ground up. What began as LambdaTest's high-performance testing cloud has now evolved into TestMu AI, an AI-native, multi-agent platform redefining modern quality engineering.

We chose the name TestMu AI to reflect our shift towards intelligent, autonomous testing. While our identity has changed, our core technology and commitment to the testing community stay the same.
